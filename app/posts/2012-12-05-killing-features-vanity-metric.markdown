title: Killing Features is a Vanity Metric

Too many lean startups brag about how quickly they kill features.  Like feature kill count is a valid measurement of how lean you are.  Killing features is great if you are taking action based on valid data, or significant feedback.  Killing a feature just because one customer doesn't like it, is just wasting time and padding your vanity stats.

>"When we started, we killed 1 in 10 features, now we are so lean we kill 3 in 10." 

Killing a feature should be based on the results of an experiment.  That actually pinpoints perhaps the biggest thing I see with startups practicing lean.

**Developing effective Lean Experiments**

It is definitely a discipline to be able to look at a problem and determine the smallest moving piece to test against.  Experiments should be developed backwards from the loop.

**Determine what you want to learn**

Start out by figuring out the single piece of data you want to learn about.  Just as with Scientific principle you want to isolate the experiment so you only have one variable at a time. Keep pairing down until you find the one thing that you can test, that can swing the pendulum.

**Set up your data collection system**

You now want to put in place the system that will track the data, that supports that learning.  This seems to be the piece that is most often glossed over.  Too many times I see the measurement not taken seriously enough.  I think some of this comes from the fact that we can easily pull data together.  If a real scientist screws up this piece they have to throw out the entire experiment.  They can't easily start over, or just gloss over this piece.

**Design your experiment**

Now figure out the smallest possible piece you can build (not necessarily with code) to test for the desired data.  This is usually much smaller than you think.  Manuel Rosso may be the king of this.  I think this is the biggest key to practicing effective lean methodology.  Many times you it will blow your mind, how simple your MVP needs to be, in order to effectively test your assumption.  As a developer I really struggle with this, since I fundamentally enjoy building stuff.  It is easy to get caught up in the thinking, that you need to build a piece that will scale, or be used long-term.  If the experiment validates your assumption, then you can refactor and build it the right way.
